# Data (R workspace)

Voting data (votes) were collated using the “hansard” R package (Odell, 2017).
Hanretty (2017) estimated through a demographic model the Leave and Remain vote shares for the constituencies.
Apostolova et al. (2017) analyzed and made available the results of the 2017 UK general election and, in particular, the number of votes taken by each party for each of the 650 constituencies.
 
## Covariates 
- Age = age of the MP
- Leave = share of Leave votes at the Brexit referendum in parliamentary constituencies
- Safe = margin of victory of each MP
- ExpEntropy = effective number of competing candidates in each parliamentary constituency
